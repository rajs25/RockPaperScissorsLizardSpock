# RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock

This is a basic game motivated from the popular show "The Bing Bang Theory". This game is an extended version of the popular game "Rock Paper Scissor". For the simplicity of the people, I have mentioned the rule of the game below: 
                              Rock -> (Rock smashes scissors) (Rock smashes lizard).
                              PAPER -> (Paper covers Rock) (Paper disproves Spock).
                              Scissors -> (Scissors cuts paper) (Scissors decapitates (cuts the head off of) lizard).
                              Lizard-> (Lizard eats paper) (Lizard poisons Spock).
                              Spock -> (Spock vaporizes rock) (Spock smashes scissors).
